    "# Downscaled cortical mircrocircuit on BrainScales-1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a 10% version of the cortical microcircuit as described in Potjans and Diesmann ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs358)) is emulated on the BrainScaleS-1 system in Heidelberg.\n",

    "The cortical microcircuit model consists of four excitatory and four inhibitory populations of LIF neurons. The connectivity between these populations follows a predefined map, as described in the original publication. Each population receives a fixed number of excitatory external inputs, modeled as Poisson-distributed stimuli with a spike rate of 8 Hz. In total, the network comprises approximately 80,000 neurons and 300 million synapses. Its large scale and biologically plausible recurrent connectivity make it a widely used benchmark in computational neuroscience. Implementing this model on the BrainScaleS-1 hardware demonstrates the hardware’s capabilities and how it can complement conventional software simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "BrainScaleS-1 is an analog wafer-scale neuromorphic system featuring over 200,000 analog circuits that emulate AdEx neuron model behavior and more than 43 million synapses for connectivity. Its analog nature enables emulation speeds 10,000 times faster than biological real-time. However, the physical modeling approach using analog circuits imposes limitations on model parametrization and size. To address these limitations, the cortical microcircuit model must be adapted before emulation to align with the constraints of the BrainScaleS-1 hardware. This adaptation process can be incorporated into a co-execution approach, where network behavior is analyzed using both conventional HPC simulations and hardware emulation. Once a suitable model is developed, the system’s significant speedup offers a distinct advantage for iterative experiments or long-duration emulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, a pre-adapted model is used, enabling execution on both the hardware and the software simulator. The adaptations involve uniformly reducing the neuron count and in-degree while preserving the original connectivity probability. To compensate for the reduced input resulting from this downscaling, synaptic weights are linearly increased. However, even with this adjustment, hardware constraints necessitate omitting some synaptic connections, leading to partial synapse loss, which is also integrated into the model. As a result, the adapted model includes 7,712 neurons and 2,373,933 internal synapses. Moreover, the external input is replaced with an external current implemented by an increased leak potential. Current-based synapses are converted to conductance-based synapses, with recalculated weights to preserve the post-synaptic potential amplitude measured from the expected mean membrane potential. Finally, synaptic time constants are increased, and normally distributed variations are introduced across all neuron parameters based on hardware calibration data. For more details on the required adaptations, refer to Schmidt ([2024](https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00034446))."

This tutorial uses a pre-mapped network description tailored to the topology of a BrainScaleS-1 wafer, which is loaded during hardware execution.

    "In general, the BrainScaleS-1 operating system can automatically generate new network topologies [[Müller (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.05.081)]. However, the size of the 10% cortical microcircuit model presents significant challenges for deployment on a single wafer. Due to limited on-chip routing possibilities between neurons and synapses and the use of non-optimal mapping algorithms it is not feasible to physically represent every synapse from the original model, requiring the omission of some synapses in the final representation. The provided pre-mapped network description represents an already optimized solution.\n",

Colored lines represent synaptic connections between the chips, while the regions corresponding to individual populations of the model are outlined with colored borders.\n",
