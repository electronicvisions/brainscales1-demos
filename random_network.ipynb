    "# Balanced Random Network on BrainScales-1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the balanced random network as described in Brunel ([2000](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008925309027)) is emulated on the BrainScaleS-1 system in Heidelberg. Simultaneously, the same network is simulated on the Jülich HPC cluster using the software simulator Nest [[Gewaltig and Diesmann (2007)](https://doi.org/10.4249/scholarpedia.1430)].\n",

    "The balanced random network consists of two populations of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons: one excitatory and one inhibitory. Connections between these populations are randomly drawn with a fixed connection probability of 0.1, ensuring that each neuron receives an equal number of incoming synapses. Additionally, each neuron is driven by Poisson-distributed spike trains from external excitatory sources.\n",
    "This model is used to study the firing characteristics of interconnected LIF neurons under varying external input spike rates and different inhibitory-to-excitatory weight ratios.\n",
    "Since the model is based on theoretical assumptions, it is scalable and serves as an excellent starting point for investigating the properties of the BrainScaleS-1 hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "BrainScaleS-1 is an analog wafer-scale neuromorphic system featuring over 200,000 analog circuits that emulate AdEx neuron model behavior and more than 43 million synapses for connectivity.\n",
    "Its analog nature enables emulation speeds 10,000 times faster than biological real-time. However, the physical modeling approach using analog circuits imposes limitations on model parametrization and size.\n",
    "Consequently, the model description of the balanced random network must be adapted before emulation to align with the constraints of the BrainScaleS-1 hardware.\n",
    "This adaptation process can be incorporated into a co-execution approach, where network behavior is analyzed using both conventional HPC simulations and hardware emulation.\n",
    "Once a suitable model is developed, the system’s significant speedup offers a distinct advantage for iterative experiments or long-duration emulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, a pre-adapted model is used, enabling execution on both the hardware and the software simulator.\n",
    "The adaptations involve uniformly reducing the neuron count and in-degree while preserving the original connectivity probability. To compensate for the reduced input resulting from this downscaling, synaptic weights are linearly increased. However, even with this adjustment, hardware constraints necessitate omitting some synaptic connections, leading to partial synapse loss, which is also integrated into the model. As a result, the adapted model includes 2,083 neurons and 690,157 internal synapses.\n",
    "Moreover, the external input is replaced by 2,083 Poisson sources, with each neuron sampling 200 connections. Current-based synapses are converted to conductance-based synapses, with recalculated weights to preserve the post-synaptic potential amplitude measured from the expected mean membrane potential.\n",
    "Finally, synaptic time constants are increased, and normally distributed variations are introduced across all neuron parameters based on hardware calibration data.\n",
    "For more details on the required adaptations, refer to Schmidt ([2024](https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00034446))."

    "In the following cell, the network parameters can be configured. The experiment code itself is stored in the _static/random_network/experiment_code folder and will be integrated later for experiment execution. This tutorial uses a pre-mapped network description tailored to the topology of a BrainScaleS-1 wafer, which is loaded during hardware execution. Consequently, network modifications are limited to neuron parameters, synaptic weight values, and external firing rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the BrainScaleS-1 operating system can automatically generate new network topologies [[Müller (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.05.081)]. However, the size of the model presents significant challenges for deployment on a single wafer. Due to limited on-chip routing possibilities between neurons and synapses and the use of non-optimal mapping algorithms it is not feasible to physically represent every synapse from the original model, requiring the omission of some synapses in the final representation. The provided pre-mapped network description represents an already optimized solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NEST simulation, a corresponding network description can be loaded, preserving the same network topology and synaptic delays as those expected on the BrainScaleS-1 system.\n",
    "\n",
    "At low inhibitory weights, the high firing rates result in the off-chip bandwidth being insufficient to capture the spikes from all neurons. To address this limitation in network configurations with elevated spike rates, an alternative mapping topology is implemented. In this approach, 30 neurons are isolated from the rest of the network and allocated to individual chips. This configuration ensures that the full bandwidth of these chips is available for spike recording, supporting firing rates of up to 2.5 kHz. As a result, the evaluation of network behavior in the high-firing regime is restricted to these 30 neurons in both emulation and simulation. However, the remaining neurons are still emulated on the hardware, as the internal communication within the system is sufficiently fast to support their activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations of the mapping results are provided below. The left panel illustrates the configuration with separated neurons, while the right panel shows the configuration without separation.\n",
    "The wafer consists of 384 rectangular chips, each containing 512 neuron circuits. The number of neurons utilized per chip is indicated by shades of blue, with darker shades representing higher neuron densities. Colored lines illustrate the synaptic connections between chips.\n",

By isolating 30 neurons for evaluation, reliable spike injection and readout are achieved even in high-firing regimes, despite the substantial speed-up factor of 10,000. Furthermore, the results highlight the hardware’s reconfigurability. While the initial network setup takes approximately one minute, subsequent adjustments, such as modifying inputs or reprogramming weights, are completed within seconds. This allows for efficient, iterative experiments once a suitable model is identified in simulation."
